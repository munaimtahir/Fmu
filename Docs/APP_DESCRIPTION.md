# SIMS — Student Information Management System
**Date:** 2025-10-09

## Plain‑Language Description
The Student Information Management System (SIMS) digitizes all student records and processes for Faisalabad Medical University (FMU), starting with the constituent Medical College (five graduate programs) and Allied Health Sciences (4–5 BS and diploma programs). It replaces paper files with a secure, role‑based web app and phased integrations.

### Core Users
- Super Admin (IT), College Admin, Program Coordinator, Exam Cell, Faculty, Finance, Students

### Major Workflows
- Admissions → Enrollment → Attendance → Assessments → Results/Transcripts → Clinical Rotations/Logbooks → Certificates → Graduation/Alumni

### Why Now
- Manual records are slow, error‑prone, and hard to audit. SIMS delivers transparency, compliance, and fast reporting for PMDC/HEC and internal governance.
