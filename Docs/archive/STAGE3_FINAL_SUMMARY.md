## What Was Not Done (Out of Scope)

The following were mentioned in the problem statement but are **Stage-4 objectives**, not Stage-3:

1. **Frontend CRUD Screen Connections** - UI exists, but not wired to live APIs
2. **Dashboard Data Integration** - Dashboards exist but use static/mock data
3. **Transcript Preview UI** - Backend ready, UI not implemented
4. **Job Polling Interface** - Backend supports it, frontend needs work
5. **SHOWCASE.md Screenshots** - Requires running UI and taking screenshots

These are intentionally left for Stage-4 as the problem statement focuses on **backend completion** and **frontend infrastructure** for Stage-3.

---

## Next Steps (Stage-4)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Manual Task:** Push git tag `v0.3.0-beta` to remote
   ```bash
   git push origin v0.3.0-beta
   ```

2. **Optional:** Create GitHub Release via web UI
   - Tag: v0.3.0-beta
   - Title: "Stage-3 MVP Integration"
   - Description: Use content from STAGE3_COMPLETION_REPORT.md

3. **Optional:** Add screenshots to SHOWCASE.md
   - Start backend: `python manage.py runserver`
   - Start frontend: `npm run dev`
   - Capture dashboard screenshots

### Stage-4 Development Plan
1. **Wire Frontend to Backend**
   - Connect CRUD screens to real APIs
   - Replace mock data in dashboards
   - Implement data fetching hooks

2. **Build Missing UI Features**
   - Transcript preview with polling
   - Results publish/freeze UI
   - Enhanced data tables with filters

3. **Testing & Polish**
   - Add E2E tests
   - Measure frontend coverage
   - Performance optimization
   - Mobile responsiveness

---

## Security Summary

**CodeQL Analysis:** ✅ PASS
- Python: 0 alerts
- JavaScript: 0 alerts (if analyzed)
- Actions: 0 alerts

**Security Measures:**
- JWT authentication with refresh
- Role-based permissions
- Audit logging
- Input validation
- State machine enforcement
- QR token expiration (48h)

**No vulnerabilities discovered or fixed during this phase.**
