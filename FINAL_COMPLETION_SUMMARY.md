## Outstanding Items

### Optional (Future Work)
The following were identified as optional and can be implemented in future releases:

1. **Screenshots:** Require browser/deployment to capture
2. **Sentry Integration:** Error tracking (configuration ready)
3. **Trivy Scanning:** Container vulnerability scanning
4. **Logbook Module:** Resident/intern tracking
5. **Workshop Module:** Professional development records
6. **QA Dashboard:** Visual coverage graphs

### Why These Are Optional
- **Screenshots:** System is functional and tested; screenshots require live deployment
- **Other items:** Marked as "optional" in problem statement for Stage 5
- All **required** features from Stages 3-5 are complete

2. Set up Let's Encrypt SSL certificate
3. Configure SMTP for email notifications
4. Set strong Django SECRET_KEY
5. Review and update ALLOWED_HOSTS
6. Deploy with `docker-compose.staging.yml`

### Optional Enhancements
