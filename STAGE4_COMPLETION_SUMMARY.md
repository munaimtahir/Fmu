## Security Considerations

### Implemented

- Role-based access control (Admin, Registrar, Faculty, Student)
- Object-level permissions (students can only view own data)
- Audit logging for all write operations
- QR token expiration (48 hours)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- State machine prevents unauthorized result changes

### Recommended for Production
- Rate limiting (django-ratelimit or nginx)
- HTTPS/SSL certificate
- Environment variable encryption
- Database encryption at rest
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (already in CI)

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- Database indexes on foreign keys (Django default)
- Unique constraints where appropriate
- Pagination on all list endpoints (50/page default)
- QuerySet optimization (select_related for transcripts)

### Recommended for Scale
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching layer
- CDN for static/media files
- Load balancer for multiple backend instances
- Database read replicas
- Async task queue scaling (multiple RQ workers)

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Transcript Storage**
   - Save PDFs to `media/transcripts/`
   - Add audit entry for each generation
   - Implement cleanup job for old PDFs

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Add date range filters
   - Add complex search operators
   - Add saved filter sets

3. **Notifications**
   - Email notifications for state changes
   - Student enrollment confirmations
   - Result publication alerts

4. **Reporting**
   - Enrollment statistics dashboard
   - Grade distribution reports
   - Attendance summary reports

5. **Mobile API**
   - Optimized endpoints for mobile
   - Push notification support
   - Offline sync capabilities
